# SHS Notifier

:warning: This project is mean to be used on [EPFL's Is-Academia](https://isa.epfl.ch). No support will be given on any other ISA infrastructures.

## Its goal

Its goal is to detect when a course is going to be available by polling ISA's website, and notifying when one or multiple courses are available.

## How to use?

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* Open up a terminal and clone the project (`git clone https://github.com/Maeeen/shs-notifier`), then type `cd shs-notifier`
* `npm i`
* `node .`
* Follow the instructions and use your keyboard!

I am looking into other ways to use it quickly - as an executable or a npm package.

## Code quality

This is not a well written program, and to be honest, I do not care. There is maybe 4 comments in the whole project. And oh yeah, I am a lazy guy.

## Project's name origin

Anyone at EPFL can guess it lol.
